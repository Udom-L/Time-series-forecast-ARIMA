__ARIMA, short for ‘Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average’ is essentially a regression model that explains a given time series based on its own past values. In order words, its own lags and the lagged forecast errors, so that  can be used to forecast future values.__

__This document summarizes how to use ARIMA model, why do we use ARIMA?, and the essential algorithm of time series ARIMA model for predicting price of crytocurrency in the future.__
